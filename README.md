# Odin Landing Page

For this project, I've created an entire landing page template. I was given two images: one displaying the complete website and another with details about fonts and colors used. The goal of this project is to replicate the design as closely as possible.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- Git and GitHub

## Skills Gained

- **Problem Solving and Research:** During this project, I faced various challenges and had to conduct research to find solutions. For instance, I had to figure out how to achieve specific design elements.
- **Flexbox Mastery:** The use of `display: flex` for layout allowed me to easily align and structure content, demonstrating my understanding of flexbox.
- **HTML and CSS Proficiency:** While I already had a solid grasp of HTML and CSS, this project provided opportunities to enhance my skills further. I worked extensively with text, block and inline elements, lists, semantic tags, and containers to create a well-structured page.
